## 2026-06-21 - Unauthorized WebSocket Mirror Connection
**Vulnerability:** The `/mirror` WebSocket endpoint allowed any device on the local network to establish a connection and stream video frames without requiring prior approval from the TV host, leading to unauthorized streaming.
**Learning:** In local network Ktor applications, standard CSWSH protections (Origin checks) do not sufficiently prevent unauthorized local devices from connecting.
**Prevention:** Always implement explicit authorization state checks (e.g., verifying against an `approvedClientIds` list) within all sensitive WebSocket endpoints before accepting connections or processing frames.
